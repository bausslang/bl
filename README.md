The primary frontend compiler for bausslang.

---

Bausslang is a static typed programming language as a simple learning project on developing a C-like programming language inspired by D, C#, Rust, Go, C and C++.

It will intiailly use a C compiler as the backend but will be abstract enough to have that changed in the future.
